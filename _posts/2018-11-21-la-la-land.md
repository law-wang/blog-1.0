La La Land is charming like nothing else: everything from the sentimental music, the fanciful images, the idealistic story. Completely romantic and mesmerizing. Chazelle’s previous work, Whiplash, was similarly stunning. But Whiplash was angry, hysterical, dangerous, saturated with sweat, tear, blood, and a risky devotion, whereas La La Land is clear, transparent, magnificent and dreamy.

It’s easily the best production of 2016, along with the likes of Kubo and the Two Strings, Arrival, and Zootopia. Many say the imperfect ending makes it unfit for the holidays and Valentines season, but it’s precisely the imperfections that make this story of lovers and dreamers real, precious, and unforgettable. Especially significant are the film’s discussions of dreams, love, and ambition, which might come across as either tragic or hopeful depending on how you look at it.
