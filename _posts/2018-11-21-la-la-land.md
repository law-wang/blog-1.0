_La La Land_ is charming like nothing else: everything from the sentimental music, the fanciful images, the idealistic story. Completely romantic and mesmerizing. Chazelle’s previous work, _Whiplash_, was similarly stunning. But _Whiplash_ was angry, hysterical, dangerous, saturated with sweat, tear, blood, and a risky devotion, whereas _La La Land_ is clear, transparent, magnificent and dreamy.

It’s easily the most impressive production of 2016, along with the likes of _Kubo and the Two Strings_, _Arrival_, and _Zootopia_. Many say the imperfect ending makes it unfit for the holidays and Valentines season, but it’s precisely the imperfections that make this story of lovers and dreamers real, precious, and unforgettable. Especially significant are the film’s discussions of dreams, love, and ambition, which might come across as either tragic or hopeful depending on how you look at it.

# Love and Dreams

Upon reviewing the story, we would realize that Sebastian and Mia were never made for each other. Friendship and love found during unfortunate times can sometimes be attributed to simply the comfort in having someone to vent all the pessimism to and earn encouraging words from— and that might just be the case for Mia and Sebastian. They found their own hopes in each other, and their way of expressing love was offering comfort when they can’t realize those hopes. Love is one of the few things they have left in their exhausted lives. It sounds wonderful on paper, but not so pretty when put into practice. That’s why the epilogue, the fantasy of them dancing in the stars, is fundamentally a paradox— if they couldn’t adapt to each other, how could they manage living together for the rest of their lives?

It’s easy to say “I love you,” but how many people can actually say that they’ve *_really_* loved? To love is to take the responsibility of your actions and to accept the weaknesses in yourself and others. We shouldn’t always live in such grand self-consolation.

I’d think Mia is, after all, selfish. She had a successful, rich boyfriend whom she dumped, and it would be logical to induce that the only reason she chose Sebastian is because she saw herself in him. The depressed, dejected dream chaser. In reality, however, there wasn’t ever a chance for her to give up everything for him. When Sebastian was on tour, slowly becoming the successful musician he’s always wanted to be, she was looking for proof that he wasn’t happy. But Sebastian does love music, and who said he didn't love touring? Mia felt imbalanced: when the dreams they associated with each other came true, they suddenly couldn’t live with each other anymore.

Ultimately, the dream that united them is precisely what separated them. Sebastian thought he found the love of his life, but really, it’s just that in a particular place, at a particular time, he met someone who needed someone. In the end, perhaps they both loved their dreams more than they loved love.
